Machine learning project predicting English Premier League match outcomes using team performance statistics and Random Forest classification.

# ⚽ EPL Match Predictor 🧠

A Machine Learning project that predicts English Premier League (EPL) match outcomes based on team statistics, rolling performance averages, and Random Forest modeling.

---

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes two seasons of English Premier League match data to **predict the probability of a team winning** their next game.  
By using rolling averages of key metrics (like goals, shots, and possession) and a Random Forest Classifier, it achieves an accuracy of around **65%** 🎯
